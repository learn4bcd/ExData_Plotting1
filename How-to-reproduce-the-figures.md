# How to reproduce the figures? #

1. Copy the data file "household\_power\_consumption.txt" to your working directory, or set the working directory to the directory containing the data file. The the data file name should be exactly as "household\_power\_consumption.txt";

1. Then you can clone the repo, copy the "plot1.R","plot2.R","plot3.R" and "plot4.R" to you working directory, and then run: "*source("plot1.R"); source("plot2.R"); source("plot3.R"); source("plot4.R");*". Copy-paste codes from each file to your R console also works.
